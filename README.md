## Project Title

Optimisation of university space based on a supply and demand analysis: A case study on staff meeting rooms and student toilet facilities on campus

## Project Background

- Without a doubt, meeting rooms and toilets are the two most obvious amentities for staff and students respectively. 
- Although the university devotes its second largest expense to allocation of space, it can always be further optimised as both staff and students activities are affected by multiple factors. 
- Studentsâ€™ activities are limited by their selected subjects, they need to know which toilets are closest to their scheduled classrooms. While staff are usually based in a single location, a preference of using the nearest meeting rooms comes naturally. 
- Other than the physical distance, the actual utilisation of meeting rooms and toilets are also affected by many other factors such as meeting room condition and equipment, accessible toilets, etc. 
- Considering those variables, this project is seeking to analyse the space data, employee and timetabling data, aiming to advise if the supply of meeting rooms and toilets on campus meets the current demand, and how the arrangement and maintenance services can be optimised accordingly.

## Data Description

- Space metadata covering meeting rooms and toilets: Room code, room capacity, room type, etc. 
- Some meeting rooms have its associated equipment data to be analysed.
- De-identified Employee data including the number of employees by building.
- Timetabling and class registration data including the subject information of the current semester.

## Expected Outcome

- The goal is to analyse the current supply and demand of meeting rooms and toilets on campus, suggest how the space arrangement of meeting rooms and toilets can be optimised, and advise how the overall space on campus can be better planned.
- A detailed analysis report is required. The analysis is expected to be conducted by campus, by building, and by different meeting room and toilet types, etc. 
- Analytical methods are to be used such as spatial analysis, correlation analysis, etc. 
- The report should include interactive maps, charts with interpretation of findings.
- Reasonable recommendations of space optimisation opportunities based on the analysis should also be included in the report.
