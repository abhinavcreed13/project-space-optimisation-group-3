In this section, we will explain our findings for buildings across different campuses. As per our previous shown data analysis, buildings with a supply-demand problem as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:floor_to} will be explored. We have completed the analysis for the following buildings where there is a supply-demand problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Redmond Barry Building, Parkville (115)  - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:redmond_floor_to}
    \item The Spot, Parkville (110) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:spot_floor_to}
    \item Glyn Davis Building, Parkville (133) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:glyn_floor_to}
    \item Medical Building, Parkville (181) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:medical_floor_to}
    \item David Caro Building, Parkville (192) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:dcaro_floor_to}

% \paragraph{Redmond Barry Building (Parkville Campus)}
% This section discusses about the findings with respect to Redmond Barry Building for supply and demand analysis, and the current location is set as \texttt{Level 2}.
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with no preference:}
%     As given in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:redmond_floor_to}, a student needs to walk at least \texttt{2 levels} in the building to get rewarding floors with sufficient supply of toilets. The results also suggests a relaxing parameter ($\delta$) of \texttt{1} and the students will not miss out floors with high rewards. Using these conditions, the result suggests that \texttt{Level 4} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{2 floors} followed by \texttt{Level 6} with \texttt{4 floors} and \texttt{Level 5} with \texttt{3 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:remond_no}.

It is suggested that a relaxing parameter ($\delta$) of \texttt{3} can help students find highly rewarding floors. The result indicates that \texttt{Level 4} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{2 floors} followed by \texttt{Level 1} with \texttt{3 floors} and \texttt{Basement 2} with \texttt{4 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:remond_covidhigh}.

    \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with high capacity:} From the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:ian_floor_to}, we find out that a student needs to walk at least \texttt{1 level} in the building to get rewarding floors with high capacity. It is also revealed that a relaxing parameter ($\delta$) of \texttt{2} can help students find highly rewarding floors. The result indicates that \texttt{Level 5} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{2 floors} followed by \texttt{Level 4} with \texttt{3 floors} and \texttt{Level 3} with \texttt{4 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:ian_highcap}.

    \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with other factors:} We have also shown other factors such as finding toilets under COVID-19 Medium Lockdown or with easy availability in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:ian_floor_to}. Using those constraints, we suggest that \texttt{Level 5} is the most rewarding floor with finding toilets with high capacity, or excellent condition. These are summarized in the below figures.
