In this section, we will explain our findings for buildings across different campuses. As per our previous shown data analysis, buildings with the supply-demand problems as shown in the below figure are analyzed. Those buildings are also chosen because of their higher floor levels. Hence, we have a better prediction when different factors are incorporated. We have completed the analysis for the following buildings:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Doug McDonell Building, Parkville (168)  - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr_floor}
    \item Alan Gilbert Building, Parkville (104) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:alan_mr_floor}
    \item Law Building, Parkville (106) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:law_mr_floor}
    \item Stop 1 Building, Parkville (199) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:stop1_mr_floor}
    \item 100 Leicester St, Parkville (278) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:edu_mr_floor}
    \item Glyn Davis Building, Parkville (133) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:glyn_mr_floor}
    \item Elisabeth Murdoch Building, Southbank (860) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:eliz_mr_floor}
    \item Werribee Veterinary Hospital, Werribee (411) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:werribee_mr_floor}

% \paragraph{Doug McDonell Building (Parkville Campus)}

% In this section, we will explain our findings of Doug McDonell Building from the perspective of supply and demand analysis.

% \begin{itemize}
%     \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with no preference:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr_floor}, a staff member needs to walk at least \texttt{3 levels} (Budget) in Doug McDonell Building to get rewarding floors with an adequate supply of meeting rooms. We also suggest a relaxing budget ($\delta$) of \texttt{4 levels} so that employee doesn't miss out on a high supply providing floors. Using these constraints, we suggest \texttt{level 8} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{7 floors} followed by \texttt{level 4} with \texttt{3 floors} and \texttt{level 7} with \texttt{6 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:doug-floor-no-factors}.

% \item \textbf{Best nearby floors under COVID-19 Strict Lockdown:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr_floor} with COVID-19 high factor, a staff member should be willing to walk at least \texttt{5 levels} (Budget) in Doug McDonell Building to get very high rewarding floors under COVID-19 lockdown with the relaxing budget($\delta$) of at least \texttt{2 levels}. Using these constraints, we suggest \texttt{level 8} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{7 floors} followed by \texttt{level 7} with \texttt{6 floors} and \texttt{level 5} with \texttt{4 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:doug-floor-covid}.

% \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with High Capacity:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr_floor} with high capacity factor, a staff member can easily find a high supply of meeting rooms providing floors in Doug McDonell building within the budget of \texttt{3 levels } and relaxing budget($\delta$) of at least \texttt{4 levels}. Using these constraints, we again suggest \texttt{level 8} as the most rewarding floor with the cost of \texttt{7 floors} followed by \texttt{level 4} with \texttt{3 floors} and \texttt{level 7} with \texttt{6 floors} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:doug-floor-capacity}.

% \item \textbf{Best nearby floors with other factors:} In the appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr_floor}, we have also shown other factors such as finding meeting rooms with equipment, excellent conditions, and easy availability with their budgets and relaxing budgets. Using those constraints, we suggest that \texttt{level 8} is the most rewarding floor for meeting rooms with equipment and finding meeting rooms in excellent condition. \texttt{level 4} is the most rewarding floor for finding meeting rooms which are easily available.
