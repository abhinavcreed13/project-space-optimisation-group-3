In this section, we will explain our findings of different buildings from the perspective of supply and demand analysis. We have used our previously described algorithm with the objective of finding $k-$best nearest buildings for booking a meeting room for different factors. We have completed the analysis for the following buildings where there is a high supply-demand problem:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Doug McDonell Building, Parkville (168) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr}
    \item 11 Barry St, Parkville (266) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:barry_mr_table}
    \item Law Building, Parkville (106) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:law_building_mr_table}
    \item David Penington Building, Parkville (102) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:david_building_mr_table}
    \item FBE Building, Parkville (105) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:fbe_building_mr_table}
    \item Medical Building, Parkville (181) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:medical_building_mr_table}
    \item Elisabeth Murdoch Building, Southbank (860) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:southbank_elisabeth_mr_table}
    \item Werribee Pathology Building, Werribee (416) - Appendix Table \ref{appendix:werribee_pathology_mr_table}
\end{itemize}

We will be summarising results for \texttt{ Doug McDonell Building}, \texttt{David Penington Building} and \texttt{Elisabeth Murdoch Building} as discussed in the below section.


\paragraph{Doug McDonell Building (Parkville Campus)}

As per our previous shown data analysis, this building is having the highest supply-demand problem as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:doug_mr_s_vs_d}.

\end{figure}

As per the above plot, we can expect that there is a high chance that staff members are not able to find adequate meeting rooms in this building. Hence, we used our algorithm to find other best nearest buildings from Doug McDonell Building based on the different factors as interpreted below.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Best nearby buildings with no preference:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr}, a staff member needs to walk at least \texttt{302 metres} (Budget) from Doug McDonell Building to get rewarding buildings with an adequate supply of meeting rooms. We also suggest a relaxing budget ($\delta$) of \texttt{96 metres} so that employee doesn't miss out a high supply providing building. Using these constraints, we suggest \texttt{University Health Services Building (385)} as the most rewarding building with the cost of \texttt{432 metres} as shown in the Figure \ref{fig:doug-mr-no-factors}.

\end{figure}

\item \textbf{Best nearby buildings under COVID-19 Strict Lockdown:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr} with COVID-19 strict factor, a staff member should be willing to walk at least \texttt{648 metres} (Budget) from Doug McDonell Building to get very high rewarding buildings under COVID-19 lockdown with the relaxing budget($\delta$) of at least \texttt{16 metres}. Using these constraints, we suggest \texttt{The Spot building (110)} as the most rewarding building with the cost of \texttt{501 metres} followed by \texttt{Alan Gilbert building (104)} with \texttt{353 metres}.

% \item \textbf{Best nearby buildings with High Capacity:} As shown in the Appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr} with high capacity factor, a staff member can easily find high supply of meeting rooms providing buildings from Doug McDonell building within the budget of \texttt{286 metres}. Using these constraints, we again suggest \texttt{Old Physics Buildings (128)} as the most rewarding building with the cost of \texttt{286 metres} followed by \texttt{Old Engineering School (173)} with \texttt{68 metres} and \texttt{Baillieu Library (177)} with \texttt{346 metres}.

\item \textbf{Best nearby buildings with other factors:} In the appendix Table \ref{appendix:doug_mr}, we have also shown other factors such as finding meeting rooms with equipment, excellent conditions and easy availability with their budgets and relaxing budgets. Using those constraints, we suggest that \texttt{Kenneth Myer Building (173) - 414 metres} is the most rewarding building for meeting rooms with equipment and finding meeting rooms in excellent condition. \texttt{University Health Services Building (385) - 432 metres} is the most rewarding building for finding easily available meeting rooms.

The results of some of the above-discussed factors are summarized below using clustering diagrams.

Using these constraints, we suggest \texttt{Old Physics Buildings (128)} as the most rewarding building with the cost of \texttt{689 metres} followed by \texttt{Kenneth Myer Building (144)} with \texttt{439 metres} and \texttt{141 Barry St (390)} with \texttt{670 metres}.
