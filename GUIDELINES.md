# Team Guidelines

## Github usage

Please try to stick to these guidelines so as to avoid code conflicts and merge issues.

- Branches are created with everyone's name. Please work on your respective branches for any new work or changes/updation. `master` branch should be kept as clean as possible.

- Merge to `master` branch should be done using `pull requests`. Before merging the pull request, it should be approved by atleast 1 member of the team. Please do not merge pull request if nobody has approved the change.

- Project management is achieved using kanban board. If any issue/task assigned to you has been completed, please move the task to `Done` column, or `In progress` if you have started working on it. This will show clear transparency as to who is working on what.
