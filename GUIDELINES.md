# Team Guidelines

## Github usage for the team

Please try to stick to these guidelines so as to avoid code conflicts and merge issues.

- Branches are created with everyone's name. Please work on your respective branches for any new work or changes/updation. `master` branch should be kept as clean as possible.

- Make sure you sync changes from `master` branch before initiating merge request so that you can verify whether any new change is causing any error with your updations.
