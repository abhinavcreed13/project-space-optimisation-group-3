## Project Data

- `uom-space`: room data including meeting room and toilet; please refer to room-category-type for room category and type definition.

- `rm-category-type`: the definition of all UoM standard room categories and types. 

- `av-equipment`: audio visual equipment data including its location information. Can be used to indicate meeting rooms' "quality".

- `em-location`: deidentified employee location. Each record represents each employee and associated loction. Can be used together with meeting room data to see, for example, if there are enough meeting rooms nearby. 

- `2020-timetable`: the latest class scheduling data including a class's time and its location. Can be analysed to indicate students' behaviors on campus and further analyse the supply and demand of toilets on campus. 

- `meeting room usage`: placeholder. We are still waiting for another team to provide this dataset.
